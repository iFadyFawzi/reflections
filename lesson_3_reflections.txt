When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  In the time I want to share my code with others.
  When I work with a team on the same file.
  Pair programming

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  To be in control

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  fork: is a clone but from GitHub to GitHub.
  clone: make a copy from repository on GitHub to local machine.
  branch: make a branch of mater branch in the same version of file.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  No repeat of merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Online websites for pair programming and it would be easier.
  Offical pair programming and it would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  when you need to stay up-to-date with changes others are making. Rather than simply pulling and pushing, you need to pull changes into your local master branch, merge the local master into your branch (different-oil, for example), then push your branch to the remote before finally merging your branch into master, either locally or on GitHub.
